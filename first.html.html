        <h1>About Me</h1>
        My name is Desiree Onyinyechi Chukwuji. I was born on the 3rd day of July, in the year 2006. I am currently 17 years old.
        I was a science student during my Secondary school days. I was also appointed as the Asst. Health Prefect during my last senior year.
        I love reading and writing novels as a pastime. I have written 1 completed novel and 5 ongoing ones. 
        I started learning tailoring when i was in Junior Secondary School Two (JSS2) simply as a hobby, but since i finished my secondary school last year, I took it up seriously and I am now a certified seamstress.
        I also love anything that has to do with computers and how websites and applications operates, it always facinated me.

        <h2> AltSchool Africa </h2>
        After spending almost a year at home, my mom heard about AltSchool Africa from her boss. We decided to check what it was about and we were happy about what we found.
        It suited our circumstances as it wasn't too expensive and it would require me to study from home. After much deliberations, we decided to go for it. 
        I am currently a Frontend Engineering Student at AltSchool Africa 2023 Tinyuka session.
        My student Id number is: ALT/SOE/023/2389

        <h3>Reason for Enrollment</h3>
        I have always been intrigued with anything that has to do with computers for as long as i can remember, so when I learnt about AltSchool, 
        I took the chance because I saw it as an opportunity for me to do what i love while being in the comfort of my home to help out.
        AltSchool Africa is a school that has teaches it students the best and I do not regret ever applying.
